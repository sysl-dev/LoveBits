# About
This is just a simple tool to make seeing what a particle system looks like easier. Renders a 3x Scale window for pixel art.

## Things to know
  * This will error with incorrect values
  * You need to edit the batch file to point to your love install
  * Export only saves to clipboard
  * This is not packed into a love file so images can be added easier for testing into the image folder

This tool was made just for me, so don't expect it to be updated unless love2d's API changes.
